## What is Makefile
The makefile is a text file that contains the recipe for building your program.
The most common use of Makefiles is to manage the dependencies of the source files of the programs during the compilation and linking (build) phase, that is, to compile only the files that need to be compiled by looking at the dependencies on each other and the last modified dates of the source files while the programs are being compiled.

```bash
make
./out
```

Output
```bash
Hello from CMake!
```
