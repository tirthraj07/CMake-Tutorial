## Introduction

CMake is a cross-platform, open-source tool that simplifies the build process for your project. By writing a simple configuration file (`CMakeLists.txt`), you can build and test code across multiple platforms and compilers.

## Getting Started

To use CMake, ensure it's installed on your system:


__On Linux__
```bash
sudo apt install cmake
```

__On MacOS__
```bash
brew install cmake
```

__On Windows__
Download the installer from https://cmake.org/download/

You can verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
cmake --version
```
